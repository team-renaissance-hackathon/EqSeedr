### An Interactive Token LaunchPad platform.

EqSeedr is a token launchpad that allows for price discovery of an asset through the process of competition. maximizing the funding raised for the project and providing an opportunity for users to earn massive gains on their capital investment. Users can make non-competing bids in the attempt to aquire as many tokens below the market bid average. Or users can make competing bids in the attempt win the tokens pool with the potential of earing 100x gains on their investment.

## Overview
there are three main phases;
* sealed-bid phase
* unsealed-bid phase
* tick-bid phase


### Sealed-Bid System
The sealed-bid phase and the unsealed-phase are part of the sealed-bid system where it's role is to serve as the Consensus mechanism for each of the rounds of hte tick-bid phase.
1. users submit a sealed bid 
2. then later reveal their bid and it gets ranked
3. the top 10 bids become the initial market bids for each round.

### Tick-Bid System
The tick-bid system is the core component that drives the price discovery process.
1. users execute the market bid and the price doubles
2. or the price decreses when a bid is not executed with in a tick
3. a tick is just a section of time that a bid must be executed.
4. the tick depth increases, keeping track of the number of ticks that have passed since the last executed bid
5. for each tick depth increase, the tokens pool also increases. creating an incentive for users to compete for the tokens pool.


## Requriements
EqSeedr is a Solana program that runs Anchor 0.30.1 Those are the only requirments to install and run.

## Shipped on devnet
EqSeedr is currently deployed on the Devnet Where will be hosting user testing. EqSeedr is in active development and we plan to launch an MVP in the near future.
